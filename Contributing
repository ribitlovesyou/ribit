## Creating New Skills & Activities

### Skills
To add a new skill, create a file in `my_digital_being/skills/` following the pattern of existing skills. Register required API keys with the `api_manager` and implement `initialize()` and your custom methods.

### Activities
To add a new activity, create a file in `my_digital_being/activities/` using the `@activity()` decorator. Set appropriate energy costs, cooldowns, and required skills.

### Architecture Guidelines

- **Prefer External APIs:** Integrate external APIs outside the core framework.
- **Modularity:** Easily integrate or remove functionalities without affecting the core.
- **Maintain Simplicity:** Keep the core framework lightweight by offloading extensions.
